# nPr-nCr-calculator
A simple combination and permutation calculator

### README Sections

## Solution
The code is written in C++.
All of the computations are done using integers. Computing large numbers will not be stored properly and the code will return incorrect answers. To combat this issue, I have written the code so that the computer does the work much like a human would.

## Implimentation
This code was intented to be compiled using the open source C++ compiler g++.
